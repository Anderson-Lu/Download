#### The given path's format is not supported in IE

Try using System.IO.Path.GetFileName to parse out the full path that IE sends. This should work on all browsers:

```csharp
var parsedFileName = Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);
```

In IE7, it looks like this:

```csharp
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="targetFile"; filename="C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\test.txt" 
```

In IE8, it looks like this:

```csharp
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="targetFile"; filename="test.txt"
```

So, change the logic in the server-side code â€“ It should not be dependent on the client-side file path location and should simply use the FileName property of the FileUpload control.
