#### The given path's format is not supported in IE

Try using System.IO.Path.GetFileName to parse out the full path that IE sends. This should work on all browsers:

```csharp
var parsedFileName = Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);
```

In IE7, it looks like this:

```csharp
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="targetFile"; filename="C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\test.txt" 
```

In IE8, it looks like this:

```csharp
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="targetFile"; filename="test.txt"
```

So, change the logic in the server-side code â€“ It should not be dependent on the client-side file path location and should simply use the FileName property of the FileUpload control.

#### Enter event doesn't work in Firefox 

Enter event like this:

```javascript
document.onkeydown = function(){
   if(event.keyCode == 13){
      //do something here
   }
}
```

In Chrome and IE, it works, but in firefox, the event object doesn't work. So the solution is let `event` be a argument:

```javascript
document.onkeydown = function(event){
   //dosomething...
}
```
#### JS startsWith() doesn't work in IE

One solution is to implement String.prototype for IE

```javascript
if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {
  String.prototype.startsWith = function(searchString, position) {
    position = position || 0;
    return this.indexOf(searchString, position) === position;
  };
}
```
#### JQuery ajax doesn't refresh in IE

Just append a random argument like this:

```javascript
&t=(new Date()).getMillianSeconds();
```
